# 🎓 KPGU Bot: Local Submission & Presentation Guide

This guide ensures your project runs perfectly on your laptop for tomorrow's submission.

## 🚀 How to Start (1-Click)
1.  **Open the Project Folder** (college-chatbot).
2.  **Double-click** the file named: `START_KPGU_BOT.bat`.
3.  Two black windows (Command Prompt) will open:
    -   **Window 1**: Backend Server (Running on port 8000).
    -   **Window 2**: Frontend UI (Running on Vite).
4.  **Wait** 10 seconds, then open your browser to:
    -   👉 `http://localhost:5173`

## 🛠️ Presentation Tips
-   **No Internet?**: The bot has a 100% "Offline Brain". If you have no internet, it will still answer using university records!
-   **Instant Answers**: I have added "Memory" (Caching). Show the professors how fast the bot is by asking the same question twice!
-   **Mobile View**: The UI is responsive. You can resize your browser to show it looks like a mobile app.

## ✅ Last Minute Checklist
1.  **Google Chrome**: Use Chrome for the best experience.
2.  **API Keys**: Your `.env` file is already set up with your Gemini Key.
3.  **Data**: All university info (Fees, Courses) is stored in `backend/data/kpgu_extended_info.txt`.

**Good luck with your submission! You've got this! 🎓🚀💎🥇**
